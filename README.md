# System Overview

This is a serverless joke generation API that:

- Uses Hugging Face‚Äôs API to generate jokes based on 3 random words.
- Stores jokes in a jokes.json file, which builds over time.
- Returns jokes via a GET endpoint (static file hosted on GitHub Pages).
- Handles rate limits gracefully: if Hugging Face API returns 429, it serves a random stored joke instead.
- Uses GitHub Actions to run serverless workflows for joke generation.
- Updates this README.md with the 5 most recently added jokes.
- Rate-limits per day based on a simple tracking system.
- Supports manual and scheduled execution of the joke workflow.

Okay, the user wants a joke using the words bicycle, volcano, and sandwich. Let me brainstorm how to connect these. Volcanoes erupt, bicycles have wheels, and sandwiches are food. Maybe something about a bicycle near a volcano and a sandwich causing an eruption. Or maybe the volcano is made of sandwich ingredients. Or a pun on "erupt" and "lunch". Let me try a setup where the volcano's eruption is related to a sandwich. Like, why did the bicycle take a sandwich to the volcano? Because it heard it was a "crust"-aceous eruption! Wait, crust from the sandwich and the volcano's eruption. Crustaceous sounds like Cretaceous, which is a geological period. That's a bit of a stretch but could work. Alternatively, maybe the bicycle wanted to avoid a meltdown by bringing a sandwich. Hmm. Or the volcano was erupting with melted cheese. Let me refine the first idea. "Why did the bicycle bring a sandwich to the volcano? It wanted to avoid a meltdown... but ended up in a crust-astrophic eruption!" No, maybe too complicated. Simplify. "Why did the bicycle take a sandwich to the volcano? It heard there was a lava-ly crust eruption!" Lava-ly (lovely) crust. That's better. Combines the sandwich's crust with the volcano's lava. Yeah, that's a punny joke. Let me check if it uses all three words correctly. Bicycle is the subject, volcano is the location, sandwich is the item. The punchline links lava (volcano) with crust (sandwich). Yep, that works. Alright, time to put it into the JSON format.

Okay, the user wants a joke that includes the words sandwich, volcano, and robot. Let me brainstorm how to connect these three elements humorously.

First, I need a setup that naturally brings these words together. Maybe a robot doing something in a volcano? Volcanoes are dramatic, so maybe the robot is working there. Now, why would a robot be at a volcano? Maybe it's a job, like delivering something. Sandwiches are unexpected in a volcano, so that could be funny. 

The punchline should play on the robot's mistake. Maybe the robot misheard an order. Instead of "sandwich," perhaps it heard "lava" related. Oh, like "lava-smoked" instead of "ham-smoked." That could work. Let me structure it:

Why did the robot chef get fired from the volcano caf√©? Because it kept serving lava-smoked sandwiches instead of ham!

Check if all three words are included. Sandwich, volcano (volcano caf√©), robot (robot chef). The punchline uses lava as a pun on ham. It's short and fits the requirements. Seems good!
